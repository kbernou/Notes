# Docker Containers
This document consists of notes taken while learning about Docker containers. While the knowledge of the containers themselves is useful in some archetectures, the interest and reason behind learning them in my case is to improve my knowlesge of DevOps.

I will be starting [here](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/docker) and will suppliment these notes with information learned from other resources.
