# Technology Notes

## Overview
This is a collection of personal notes and quick references that I'm creating as I go through and learn new (to me) technologies.

## Learning Goals
This is a list of topics that are valuable to learn from a professional standpoint. It also happens that all this stuff fascinates me, and I find enjoyable to spend my time on.

Notes should also be taken during the learning process for each topic to reinforce what was learned, as well as to create a quick reference.

This list is _roughly_ in order of priority.

## General

### Note Taking
*  ~~[Markdown](./Markdown.md)~~ Complete!
    * ~~Store this on GitHub~~
* LaTeX 

## Tech

### Containerization and Orchestration (Primary Reason: DevOps)
* [Docker](./Docker.md)
    * [Tutorial](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/docker)
* [Kubernetes](./Kubernetes.md)
    * [Tutorial](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes)
    * Kubernetes is often seen as the enterprise grade solution, whereas Docker Swarm is the small to medium scale solution. With that said, Kubernetes is very widespread, and having it is valuable and will help with learning Swarm or getting a foot in the door since they both fulfil similar roles.
* Vagrant?

### CI/CD Pipeline (DevOps)
* Jenkins
    * Fairly common and poweful
* Ansible
    * Faily common and powerful when it comes to automation
* AWS
    * Another common one
    * [AWS Certified DevOps Engineer â€“ Professional (Free)](https://www.aws.training/learningobject/wbc?id=34146)
* Azure DevOps
 
## Broadened Horizons

### Functional Programing
* Elixir
   * Mnesia (Distributed ETS)
   * Phoenix (as well as LiveView in particular)
* Elm
   * An alternative to JS in the front end that's generally praised? Sign me up!
* Clojure
   * Functional, hearing about it more and more, also generally praised.

### Scripting Languages
* Python
* Bash
* Powershell

### Misc.
* gRPC/protobuf
  * Seems to be up-and-coming, may take some space from REST
* Go
* Ruby
* TypeScript
   * Fixes Javascript, gaining popularity (thank goodness)
### Serverless/Cloud Infrastructure
* AWS
