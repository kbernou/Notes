# Technology Notes
This is a collection of personal notes and quick references that I'm creating as I go through and learn new (to me) technologies.

## Learning Goals
This is a list of topics that are valuable to learn from a professional standpoint. It also happens that all this stuff fascinates me, and I find enjoyable to spend my time on.

Notes should also be taken during the learning process for each topic to reinforce what was learned, as well as to create a quick reference.

This list is _roughly_ in order of priority.

## General

## Broadened Horizons

### Functional Programing
* Elixir
   * Mnesia (Distributed ETS)
   * Phoenix (as well as LiveView in particular)
* Clojure
   * Functional, hearing about it more and more, also generally liked among its community.

### Misc.

* Go
* Rust 
* TypeScript
   * Fixes Javascript, gaining popularity (thank goodness)
