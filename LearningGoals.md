# Learning Goals
This is a list of topics that are currently valuable to learn in order to further my career. The idea is to keep up with the times and increase my value as an employee, and career prospects. These are also things which I personally find interesting.

Notes should also be taken during the learning process for each topic to reinforce what was learned, as well as a quick reference.

This list is _roughly_ in order of priority.

## Note Taking
*  ~~[Markdown](./Markdown.md)~~ Complete!
    * ~~Store this on GitHub~~
* LaTeX 

## Containerization and Orchestration (Primary Reason: DevOps)
* [Docker](./Docker.md)
    * [Tutorial](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/docker)
* [Kubernetes](./Kubernetes.md)
    * [Tutorial](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes)
    * Kubernetes is often seen as the enterprise grade solution, whereas Docker Swarm is the small to medium scale solution. With that said, Kubernetes is very widespread, and having it is valuable and will help with learning Swarm or getting a foot in the door since they both fulfil similar roles.
* Vagrant?

## CI/CD Pipeline (DevOps)
* Jenkins
    * Fairly common and poweful
* Ansible
    * Faily common and powerful when it comes to automation
* AWS
    * Another common one
    * [AWS Certified DevOps Engineer â€“ Professional (Free)](https://www.aws.training/learningobject/wbc?id=34146)
* Azure DevOps
 
## Broadened Horizons

### Functional Programing
* Elixir
* Clojure

### Scripting Languages
* Python
* Bash
* Powershell

### Misc.
* Go
* Ruby
* TypeScript
   * While it isn't too far off from JS, it's gaining popularity and familiariy with it would be a boon. 've also encountered problems in projects at work that would have been circumvented with proper typing.

## Serverless/Cloud Infrastructure
* AWS
