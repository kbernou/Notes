# Learning Goals
This is a list of topics that are currently valuable to learn in order to further my career. The idea is to keep up with the times and increase my value as an employee, and career prospects. These are also things which I personally find interesting.

Notes should also be taken during the learning process for each topic to reinforce what was learned, as well as a quick reference.

This list is _roughly_ in order of priority.

## Note Taking

## Virtualization (Primary Reason: DevOps)

* Kubernetes
    * [Tutorial](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes)
    * Kubernetes is often seen as the enterprise grade solution, whereas Docker Swarm is the small to medium scale solution. With that said, Kubernetes is very widespread, and having it is valuable and will help with learning Swarm or getting a foot in the door since they both fulfil similar roles.
* Vagrant?

* AWS
    * [AWS Certified DevOps Engineer â€“ Professional (Free)](https://www.aws.training/learningobject/wbc?id=34146)
