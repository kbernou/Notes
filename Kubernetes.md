# Kubernetes
This document consists of notes taken while learning about Kubernetes. The primary reason behind learning this is for DevOps, but it's becoming widespread on its own and is excellent to have knowledge on.

I will be starting [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/) and will also suppliment these notes with information learned from other resources.
